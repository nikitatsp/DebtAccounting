## Screens

1. **Home Screen**
   - Displays a list of items.

## Architecture

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern:

- **Model**: Handles the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Manages the user interface and displays data to the user.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, handling user inputs and updating the model.
